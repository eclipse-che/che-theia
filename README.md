## What is Che-theia ?
[Eclipse Che](https://eclipse.org/che/) provides a default web IDE for the workspaces which is based on the [Theia](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia) project. It’s a subtle different version than a plain  Theia(https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia) as there are functionalities that have been added based on the nature of the Eclipse Che workspaces. We are calling this version of Eclipse Theia for Che: Che-Theia.

So, Che-Theia is the default `Che editor` provided with developer workspaces created in [Eclipse Che 7](https://eclipse.org/che/)([Github](https://github.com/eclipse/che)).

Che-Theia contains additional extensions and plugins which have been added based on the nature of Eclipse Che workspaces and to provide the best IDE experience of Theia within Che.
 - A VSCode-like IDE experience. Che-Theia is based on the monaco
   editor and includes features like the command pallete.
 - VSCode extension compatibility. Che-Theia supports VSCode
   extensions. In Che-theia, these extensions could come with a side-car
   containers with all the dependencies required by the extension.
   No need to install the JDK or Maven when you install our VSCode Java plugin.
 - Nice views to interact with your user containers or production runtime containers.
   (Terminal access, execute Che-commands in specific containers, etc...)

## Che-Theia capabilities
In Che-Theia, you’ll find the following capabilities:


| Plug-in               | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| Che Extended Tasks    | Handles the Che commands and provides the ability to start those into a specific container of the workspace. |
| Che Extended Terminal | Allows to provide terminal for any of the containers of the workspace. |
| Che Factory           | Handles the Eclipse Che Factories [TODO: LINK] |
| Che Container         | Provides a container view that shows all the containers that are running in the workspace and allows to interact with them. |
| Che Dashboard         | Allows to integrate the IDE with Che Dashboard and facilitate the navigation. |
| Che Welcome Page      | Display a welcome page with handy links when opening the IDE. |
| Che Ports             | Allows to detect when services are running inside of the workspace and expose them. |
| Che APIs              | Extends the IDE APIs, to allow interacting with the Che specific components (workspaces, preferences, etc.). |



## Project structure

- [dockerfiles](./dockerfiles) contains Dockerfiles for plugin sidecars, theia-editor and theia builder,
- [extensions](./extensions) contains Che-Theia specific extensions,
- [plugins](./plugins) contains Che-Theia plugins.
- [generator](./generator) contains Che-Theia [generator](./generator/README.md)

Che-theia editor is a container image which contains the Che-theia IDE web application.

The che-plugin of this editor is defined in the plugin registry https://github.com/eclipse/che-plugin-registry/blob/master/v3/plugins/eclipse/che-theia/next/meta.yaml

[dockerfiles/theia](./dockerfiles/theia) folder contains the container image sources of `eclipse/che-theia`:
- Using a Docker multistage build and [dockerfiles/theia-dev](./dockerfiles/theia-dev) as builder.
- Cloning [Theia](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia)
- Using `che-theia init` command to decorate Theia with Che-theia plugins and extensions. All plugins and extensions are defined in [che-theia-init-sources.yml](./che-theia-init-sources.yml)
- Using `yarn` to build theia + che-theia extensions + che-theia plugins
- Assembling everything and using `che-theia production` to make the che-theia webapp.
- Copying the che-theia webapp into the runtime container and creating the Che-theia image.
